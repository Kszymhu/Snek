A simple, pixel-art Snake

1. Platforms:
PC, Android

2. Elevator pitch:
Player controls a snake on a grid-based board, with a task to gather as many points as possible. Points are gained by eating mice,
while biting into the walls or snake kills the player.

3. Core mechanics:
3.1. Snek movement
Player snek consists of segments, stored in a list. Each segment contains a queue of turns that it has to make,
with the amount of items in the queue being equal to the segments index in the list of segments. 
This is achieved by adding index-1 “don’t turn” commands to the turns queue, which causes them to be offset by index. After performing a turn, 
each segment moves one tile in the direction of its local “up”.
3.2. Adding snek segments
Add the beginning of a cycle, if the player is meant to grow, the snek grows one segment. When growing, only the snek head turns and moves, 
to make room for the added segment which is inserted into the list of segments at index 1, with position and rotation of the head, 
and its command from the beginning of this cycle.
3.3. Spawning mice
Mice are stored in a list of coordinates. When the amount of mice is smaller than the desired amount of mice, 
a new mouse is spawned. Position of the new mouse is determined by choosing a random position from empty positions.
3.4. Collisions
Every time the cycle ends, the position of every segment in segments list is checked to see if any other list of objects contains it, 
or if it is contained two times in the segment list. Depending on the outcome, one of below will happen:
a. player dies
b. player grows
c. nothing



4. Detailed overview of mechanics:
4.1. World generation
WorldGenerator fields:
a. Vector2Int size
b. List<Vector2Int> wallCoords
c. List<Vector2Int> floorCoords
d. List<Vector2Int> freeCoords
e. List<Vector2Int> segmentCoords
f. List<Vector2Int> miceCoords
  
World generator methods:
a. WorldGenerator(Vectir2Int size)

All of the world generation is performed by an object of the WorldGenerator class, inside WorldManager.
At the beginning of the game GameController creates an instance of WorldGenerator, passing in the Vector2Int size. 
Then, the WorldGenerator constructor takes those values and fills wallCoords and floorCoords accordingly, and after that copies the contents of floorCoords into freeCoords, 
and assigns segmentCoords and miceCoords to empty lists. The last thing it does is to pick a random starting point from freeCoords, with its coordinates being greater or equal 
to 2 and smaller or equal to size.axis - 2. After the world had been generated, the only task of WorldGenerator is to store world data.

4.2. World management
WorldManager fields:
a. WorldGenerator worldGenerator
b. int miceTarget

WorldManager methods:
a. UpdateFreeCoords()
b. UpdateMiceCoords()
c. UpdateSegmentCoords(List<Vector2Int> segmentCoords)

WorldManager is responsible for keeping the data about the world up-to-date, by housing methods for updating data sotred in WorldGenerator.
UpdateFreeCoords() which goes through every position in wallCoords and checks if it is contained in segmentCoords or miceCoords
and then updates freeCoords accordingly.
UpdateMiceCoords(), while worldGenerator.miceCoords.Count < miceTarget, adds new mice by choosing random positions from worldGenerator.freeCoords.
UpdateSegmentCoords(List<Vector2Int> segmentCoords) assigns segmentCoords to worldGenerator.segmentCoords
